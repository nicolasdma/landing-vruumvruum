    description: [
      "WalletConnect enables a decentralized way to accept crypto payments directly from EVM-compatible wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. It supports tokens such as ETH, USDT, MATIC, and more, without requiring any third-party intermediaries or KYC.",
      "The frontend implementation involves displaying purchases options tied to fixed USD amounts (e.g., 1,000 GC for $10). It uses the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time conversion rates, calculates the equivalent crypto amount, and initiates the transaction through the user‚Äôs wallet.",
      "After the user completes the payment, the backend listens for on-chain confirmation using Alchemy webhooks or ethers.js polling. Once verified ‚Äî including recipient, sender, and amount ‚Äî it credits the user‚Äôs GC balance and logs the transaction in Supabase.",
      "This setup provides full control over the payment process, avoids compliance friction, and lays the foundation for a Web3-native experience. However, it requires more technical effort and doesn‚Äôt support fiat or card payments.",

      "CoinGate provides a fast and simple way to accept both fiat and cryptocurrency payments through a centralized API. It supports more than 50 cryptocurrencies and allows customers to pay via credit card, Apple Pay, or crypto wallets.",
      "The frontend implementation involves embedding CoinGate‚Äôs checkout buttons tied to the GC purchase tiers. Upon purchase, the backend listens for payment confirmation through CoinGate webhooks and validates the payment details (amount, user ID).",
      "Once validated, the backend credits the correct GC amount to the user and stores the transaction for reference.",
