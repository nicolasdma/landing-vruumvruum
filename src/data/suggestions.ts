      "We will implement a crypto-native payment system using WalletConnect, wagmi, and viem. Users will be able to buy in-game currency (GC) using EVM-compatible tokens like ETH, USDT, and MATIC.",
      "The frontend will present 5 purchase options (1,000 GC to 10,000 GC) tied to fixed USD values. It fetches real-time conversion rates using the CoinGecko API, calculates the required crypto, initiates the transaction via the user‚Äôs wallet, and logs the transaction hash.",
      "The backend (Supabase + optional Node.js/Edge Functions) confirms transactions using Alchemy webhooks or ethers.js polling. After validating the recipient, sender, and amount, it credits the user's GC balance and stores the transaction.",

      "The frontend implementation involves embedding CoinGate‚Äôs checkout buttons tied to the GC purchase tiers. Upon purchase, the backend listens for payment confirmation through CoinGate webhooks and validates the payment details (amount, user ID).",
      "Once validated, the backend credits the correct GC amount to the user and stores the transaction for reference.",
